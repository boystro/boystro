## Detailed Info
I am currently a College student in my 2nd Year Bachelor degree.<br/>
I have completed a few projects based on my knowledge. However, they are not available on my GitHub profile as I didn't have a GitHub Account Back then, and due to certain issues with my old computer. The files are lost.<br/>
😀 Let's not dwell in the past, I will be having most of my project here from now on. So stay tuned if you are interested.

#### Lets talk in detail about the things I know.
- **PYTHON** <br/>
  - Basics, Random, Numpy, Matplotlib.pyplot, Turtle, Time, Pygame, Multithreading, Multiprocessing, Pandas, Kivy, Flask, Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow, Keras, Django
  - Misc - Python Knowledge, that is not known to normal Programmers. 
    Like, *"did you know, almost everything in python is object, including integers and floats?"*
- **HTML & CSS** <br/>
  - HTML5, for the html version I currently use, though I started with HTML 1, as it was in my school course, and I got my interest from there.
  - CSS3, Learned it and worked on it a lot, still somehow mess things up sometimes, but thanks to experience, I can fix it.
  - SASS (CSS with style), CSS is more lengthy to write than SASS, it makes designing easier and quicker.
- **JS** <br/>
  Keeping it sperately here (People Might expect it to go with HTML and CSS), as I didn't even know about this thing until Nov, 2020, It is a great language, and I really love the fact you can actually modify existing web-pages. This adds so much to the UX aspect of a web-page. Though, I don't really have much knowledge about it. Never used it much vigorously, only here and there to add a little dynamism to web-page.
- **3D Modelling** <br/>
  Why did I even get interested in it? <br/>
  I really wanted to create completely computer generated photorealistic images. But, was never able to do it in photoshop. Thought, Making 3D stuff in 2D plane is hard. Let's go 3D, the software is going to conver it to 3D for me. I couldn't be more wrong. Anyways, I struggled and practiced. And after 2 years of modelling experience, I can make decent looking 3D models in few hours, given I have 2-3 reference images.
- **C++** <br/>
  As I have learned, it is one of the fastest🚀 programming languages. Also, it is popular, so resources should be available if not abundant. So, it got me really excited. (Surprized, it is easier than people make it sound)
- **C** <br/>
  The first ever programming language I learned, I have a certain amount of appreciation towards this language, but it doesn't interest me much. So, no plans for further improvement at the moment.
- **Making Presentations** <br/>
  It is one of the easiest things to learn, but yet one of the hardest to master. I will say, my experience with UI design in web, and my Minimalistic taste, make my presentations look good most of the time. I often find it uneasy, when I see presentations where people write books on slide 🤮. But, I am glad, I am not one of them.
